# Excel-and-PowerBi-project
This project is based on house price data in New York, Boston.
In this project I clean the large data set using Microsoft Excel, then create a powerful dashboard in Power BI for visualisation of the data.
My explanation for how I cleaned the data in Excel is also included in the Excel workbook.
